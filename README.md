# Calculator-Application
Here we will be making a simple calculator in which we can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
#Promting input from the user. n1 = float(input("Enter the First Number: ")) n2 = float(input("Enter the Second Number: "))
#addition. print("{} + {} = ". format(n1, n2)) ...
#subtraction. print("{} - {} = ". ...
#multiplication. print("{} * {} = ". ...
#division. print("{} / {} = ".
